All BUT the kill command works. You're able to execute multiple processes at the same time, you can run the kill command and it'll identify if the pid exists or not, but I can't seem to figure out how to script the killProcess function in kernel.c which is the root of my issue.

To verify my work, run my diskc.img in the simulator.jar application. You're welcome to recompile the image by running ./compileOS.sh but the image should already be up to date.
