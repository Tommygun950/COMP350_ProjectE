# COMP350_ProjectC

All objectives have been met for this project including the readFile, executeProgram, & terminate functions to kernel.c, updating the handleInterrupt21 function to incorperate the new functions in kernel.c, creating the shell.c script and the required functions as well. Shell.c even allows for input validation as requested.

To verify my work, run my diskc.img in the simulator.jar application. You're welcome to recompile the image by running ./compileOS.sh but the image should already be up to date.
